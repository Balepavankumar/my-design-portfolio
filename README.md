A Quick Return Mechanism is a mechanical system used to convert rotary motion into reciprocating motion, where the return stroke is faster than the forward stroke.
This mechanism is commonly used in:
•	Shaper machines
•	Slotter machines
•	Milling machines
It improves productivity by reducing the time taken for the return stroke, which does not involve cutting.
Working Principle
The mechanism uses different angular velocities during the forward and return strokes. This is usually achieved using a crank and slotted lever mechanism, Whitworth mechanism, or hydraulic systems
Real life Application:-
Shaping Machine Example:
•	During the forward stroke, the tool removes material.
•	During the return stroke, the tool moves back quickly to start the next cut.
 Advantages
•	Saves time (higher productivity)
•	Simple and reliable mechanism
•	Can be driven manually, electrically, or hydraulically
 Disadvantages
•	Forward stroke speed is limited by mechanism
•	Some setups can be mechanically complex
