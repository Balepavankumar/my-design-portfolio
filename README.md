# Quick Return Mechanism – SolidWorks 2024

This repository contains a 3D mechanical design of a Quick Return Mechanism, created using ‘SolidWorks 2024’. The mechanism demonstrates how the return stroke of a tool (such as in a shaper machine) is made faster than the forward (cutting) stroke — increasing manufacturing efficiency.

# Software Used

- ‘SolidWorks 2024’ – 3D part and assembly modeling
- eDrawings (optional) – for viewing models without SolidWorks
- PDF viewer – for opening the design report

Mechanism Overview
The Quick Return Mechanism is widely used in:
•	Shaping machines
•	Slotting machines
•	Other reciprocating machine tools
 Working Principle
•	Uses a crank and slotted lever or Whitworth mechanism
•	Forward stroke (cutting) is slower for accuracy
•	Return stroke (non-cutting) is faster to save time
•	Achieved by varying crank angles for each stroke
 How to Open
1.	Open SolidWorks 2024
2.	Go to File → Open and select Quick_Return_Assembly.SLDASM
3.	Ensure all .SLDPRT files are in the same directory or referenced correctly
4.	Optionally, run Motion Study to see mechanism in action
